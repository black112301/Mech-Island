# Mech Island

## 📝 About

Mech Island is a mech-inspired first person shooter where the player must survive as many rounds of enemies as possible.

Made for MechJam 2 but decided to spend more time on it to add more mechanics. Built using [Unity2D](https://unity.com/) and C#. 
Most Models and animations were made by me using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). 
Other models downloaded from [CGtrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/).
